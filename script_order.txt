drug time series information script sequence

1. drug_dataPrep.ipynb 
    run once for each input file (3 input files 2000 - 2017)
    gets around the R issues with reading the files (inconsistent column numbers etc)
    saves out
    
2. drug_dataPrep_r.R
    reads in and concatenates the 3 files above
    applies date cutoffs
    takes the top n occuring drugs
    saves out
    
3. timeSeries_prep.ipynb
    fills time series to one reading each month
    performs lvcf interpolation
    saves out
    
4. drug_combinations.R
    reads in time series
    generates per month combinations in alphabetical order
    saves out
    
## analysis plan

i. for first version establish absolute date cut off:
    train 2010 - 2015
    require alive at end train period
    outcome all cause mortality 2015 - 2016
    include all durations of therapy information
    left and right pad with 'nil'
ii. mean target encode each combination - ? with and without weighting for time prior to outcome assessment
iii. embed into phase space ?dimension n
iv. autoencoder embedding
v. classifier

## notes
need to decide bin size during (1) and save out in a config file
if no prescription per ID within one time neeed to add one with 'nil'
